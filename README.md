## The Test

Spend no more than 4 hours creating a page that searches [this free API](https://github.com/typicode/jsonplaceholder#jsonplaceholder) for posts by a user ID and displays it on a page using Javascript.

You may optionally make additional calls to include other information such as who the user is, how many comments are found for a post, or anything else the API allows.

The design of the page is up to you, but you can refer to this as a guide:

## Development

* Clone or download this repo
* Make your changes to CSS and JS files in either:
  * `./assets/src` (see [Optional](#optional))
  * `./assets/dist`
* Make HTML changes to `./index.html`

When complete, either push up a branch on this repo (`git push origin <your branch name>`) and let us know, or send your changes to us via email.

#### Optional

This repo contains build tools for SCSS and browser sync which allow you to work with the files in the `assets/src` directory. If you would like to use these tools while developing, follow these steps:

* Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
* `yarn install`
* `gulp`
