## The Test

In this test you'll be creating a page that searches [this free API](https://github.com/typicode/jsonplaceholder#jsonplaceholder) for posts created by a user given the user's ID. The API should be queried using Javascript.

This test has no time limit, although it's recommended that you spend no more than 6 hours on it. The design of the page is up to you ([example design](https://github.com/malcolm-mclean/endpoint-test/blob/master/documentation/sample_mockup.png)).

### What we're looking for

The basics:

- Does the search work properly?
- Is the page mobile friendly?
- Are there red flags in the JS? _ex: poor performance, difficult to read code, etc_
- Does the HTML structure of the page use semantic tagging?
- Are there red flags in the CSS/SCSS? _ex: excessive use of floats, excessive explicit widths, etc_

Nice-to-haves:

- Does the search have validation?
- Does the search handle errors?
- Does the page display a loading state?

## How to complete this test

- Clone or download this repo
- Make your changes to CSS and JS files in either:
  - `/assets/src` (see [Optional](#optional))
  - `/assets/dist`
- Make HTML changes to `index.html`

When you have finished, open a pull request or email your changes to us with an attached ZIP folder. Please include a description of the changes you made, time it took you to complete the test, and any other information you feel is relevant.

### Optional

This repo contains build tools for SCSS/JS using Gulp and Browser Sync which allow you to work with the files in the `/assets/src` directory. If you would like to use these tools while developing, follow these steps:

- Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
- `yarn install`
- `yarn run gulp`
